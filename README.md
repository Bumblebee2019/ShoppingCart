### Shopping Cart Using Model-View-Controller

MVC is a great design pattern for programs that call for separation of concerns. Model is responsible for data management and interaction with the database. View represents the UI. Controller handles user input and interacts with the Model to update the View.
I decided to learn MVC by creating a simple shopping cart program, where the user writes an item description and chooses the number of items to add to cart.
